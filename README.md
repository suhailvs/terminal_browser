- Customizable keymap to adjust the controls to your liking.
- Lightweight bookmarking system.
- Help overlay with keybindings.
- Readability integration to clean and simplify webpage content.

## Dependencies:

- `requests`: For making HTTP requests.

- `readability`: For cleaning and simplifying webpage content.
- `BeautifulSoup4`: For parsing HTML.

## Installation:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/suhailvs/terminal_browser
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd terminal_browser
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage:

Simply run the `main.py` script:

```
python main.py
```

Upon launch, the default starting page is "https://example.com". You can
navigate to different URLs, search for terms using DuckDuckGo Lite, bookmark
your favorite pages, and much more.

### Keybindings:

- `q`, `Q`, `esc`: Quit the browser.
- `i`: Jump to the URL bar.
- `enter`: Load the URL or search for a keyword.
- `backspace`: Go back to the previous page.
- `b`: Bookmark the current URL.
- `?`: Toggle help screen.

You can also customize the keybindings by modifying the `keymap.json` file.

## Customizing:

### Key Map:

The key bindings for various actions can be modified by adjusting the `keymap.json` file.

For example, to change the quit key to `ctrl q`, you can modify the file like:

```json
{
    "quit": ["ctrl q"],
    ...
}
```

### Themes:

The color scheme of the interface can be modified by adjusting the `palette` in the main function.
